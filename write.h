/*
A main writing program
    Will attempt to access the resources using the semaphore
        Once in, it should display the last line added to the file (use shared memory to
        contain the size of the last line).
        Prompt the use for the next line.
        Once a new line is read, write that to the file, update the shared memory and then
        release the semaphore
You do not need a run target in your makefile
